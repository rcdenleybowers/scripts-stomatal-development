# scripts-stomatal-development
A collection of python scripts and the data they analyse that was used in my doctoral thesis, "The Economics of Stomatal Development"

## Divided into four branches:
1. original model:  
        ODE model generated to describe stomatal development using data from young, medium-aged and mature leaves.
2. 8 - parameter model:
        ODE model generated using data from young leaves, with seperate MC and GMC variables
3. 6 - parameter model:
        adapted from 2., with combined MC/GMC variable, SPC
4. Energetics data:
       scripts used to analyse energetics data.
       
The master branch contains a copy of the thesis and graphpad files of the datasets not analysed using python, namely the ATP assays and the phenotype analysis.
